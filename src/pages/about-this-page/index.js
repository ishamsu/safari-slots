        As I was browsing through the Nagerhole Safari booking website, I found
        the user experience to be poor. To check the availability of slots for a
        specific day, I had to select the date first and then choose each time
        slot available for that day to view the count for each slot. This
        process was time-consuming and frustrating. To improve the user
        experience, I created a new page that allows me to instantly view all
        the slots for a specific day along with their count. This streamlined
        the process and made it easier and quicker for me to search for
        available slots for the safari.
